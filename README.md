# Linear-Model-to-Explain-Life-Expectancy

Life expectancy is defined as a mathematical estimation of how many years a person is expected to survive. This project aims to explain the life expectancy in the world for the year 2020 through a linear model based on the dataset of the World Development Indicators (WDI) derived from a primary World Bank database for development data from officially recognized international sources.
